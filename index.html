<p>My name is Noah Hutchinson, I grew up in Maine with my two parents older sisters and my younger brother. 
I was always interested in playing video games in my spare time. As a child I had a lot of spare time.
Once I was able to work I got my first job at a summer camp for spoiled rich kids. I never worked with children again after that. 
I went through a multitude of jobs in my life thus far, including working on a haunted walk, and a lobster pound that 
was on national news. My favorite job though was enlsted in the United States Marine Corp. </p>
